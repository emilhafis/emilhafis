**3.2 DefiniTion of A Business AnAlysT**

Those who perform business analysis are commonly called business analysts, but there are business analysis professionals with other job titles who also perform business analysis activities. Some business analysis professionals are specialized and therefore have a title that reflects that area of their competency: strategic business analyst, data analyst, process analyst, or systems analyst are a few examples of these roles. How an organization uses business analysis resources; where these resources functionally report; and the type of industry, type of project, and type

of project life cycle being used are some of the factors that influence how organizations title those who have the responsibility for business analysis.

There are also many roles where business analysis is performed as a part of the role but is not necessarily the only responsibility. Enterprise and business architects; portfolio, program, project managers; and operational analysts are a few examples. The business analysis processes, tools, and techniques presented in this guide and standard are relevant to these individuals, too. Because there are many titles and variations of business analysis roles in use, this guide and standard use the phrase business analysis professional over business analyst. When the term business analyst is used, it is done for the sake of brevity and should always be considered a reference to anyone performing business analysis regardless of the title a person holds or the percentage of job function spent on the work. The objective of this guide and standard is to establish an understanding about business analysis and not job titles.

**3.3 The Business AnAlysT’s spheRe of influence**

**3.3.1 ovERviEW**

Business analysts may lead, but they do not oversee project resources; this is the work of the project manager. A lead business analyst may oversee the work of less experienced business analysts on the team, or a manager of business analysis may be responsible for managing a pool of business analyst resources from an assignment or allocation perspective. At the project level, it is the project manager who is responsible for resource allocation, scheduling, and work progress, including that of business analysts.

Business analysts do manage stakeholder engagement, which is often considered an area of overlap with project managers. Looking more closely, business analysts have different objectives from project managers; therefore, each role manages engagement with stakeholders for different purposes. The business analyst’s objective is to ensure that stakeholders remain engaged throughout the entire business analysis process so that the information required to build the solution is attained through ongoing discovery and collaboration and the solution design ultimately meets the needs of the business. The business analyst needs to be aware of stakeholder expectations, availability, and individual interests and the impact each has on the ability to successfully elicit the product requirements. When the dynamics are a cause for one stakeholder group to overpower or shut down another, or when a particular stakeholder becomes disinterested in the solution and begins to withdraw in requirements workshops, it is the business analyst’s responsibility to take charge and resolve these situations. Because stakeholder relationships are managed across the project by the project manager, the best tactic is for the business analyst and project manager to work together when

stakeholder situations arise regarding the solution. More information about the business analyst’s role in managing stakeholder relationships can be found in Section 5.

A business analyst works with stakeholders to elicit and analyze business analysis information and evolve and develop the product requirements and other information necessary to achieve a common understanding of the product features across the product team. This makes relationship building and management a very important aspect of the business analyst role. Business analysts maintain a range of relationships that influence the business analysis work. Figure 3-1 highlights some of the stakeholder relationships that business analysts need to manage within their sphere of influence.
