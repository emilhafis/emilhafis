Recommended tools

Since BPMN is a standard, if you already have a favorite tool which supports BPMN 2.0 you can continue using it :)

If you do not have one, I have a few recommendations:&#x20;

a) ADONIS:Community Edition ([**adonis-community.com**](http://en.adonis-community.com/)). This is a free (also for commercial purposes) cloud-based modeling tool with BPMN support and much more. I will be using it in the course as my main tool.

If you are a teacher you can also check ADONIS Academy Edition ([**https://www.boc-group.com/en/adonis/get-started/**](https://www.boc-group.com/en/adonis/get-started/)). It is free just like ADONIS:Community, but offers many additional possibilities like process simulation, support for DMN standard, lecture materials and more!

b) If you just want to create a diagram and export it to BPMN XML without any registration please take a look at [**https://bpmn.io/**](https://bpmn.io/)

c) Other tools which allow you to create BPMN diagrams and exchange BPMN XML are: Camunda Modeler and Bizagi Modeler

I would not recommend you using diagramming tools like draw.io/diagrams.net since they most commonly support only BPMN shapes but with very limited support for validation. Also diagrams you create in such tools cannot be exchanged in other tools.

If you have any questions let me know!
