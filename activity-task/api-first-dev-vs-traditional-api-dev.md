# API First Dev vs Traditional API Dev

**Inside-out thinking**&#x20;

means **your focus is on processes, systems, tools, and products that are designed and implemented based on internal thinking and intuition**. The customer's needs, jobs, and perspectives do not play a part in this type of thinking; they aren't taken into consideration.

**Outside-in thinking**&#x20;

is **a new approach to customer and partner engagement that focuses on designing business models, processes, and services according to the customer's wants and needs**. In this approach, the customer's perspective and context comes first.
