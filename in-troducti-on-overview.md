# IN TRODUCTI ON Overview

According to PMI’s Pulse of the Profession ® In-Depth Report: Requirements Management: A Core Competency for Project and Program Success \[1], 1 47% of unsuccessful projects fail to meet original goals due to poor requirements management. In the 2017 Pulse Report: Success Rates Rise—Transforming the High Cost of Low Performance \[2], 39% of failed projects identify inaccurate requirements gathering as a primary cause of failure.

**1.3.3 Business Analysis Knowledge Areas**&#x20;

Knowledge Areas are fields or areas of specialization that are commonly employed when performing business analysis. A Knowledge Area is a set of processes associated with a particular function. In this guide, the Knowledge Areas presented contain the set of processes that comprise the work of business analysis. The processes, though related, do not prescribe a sequence or order. The guide covers the following Business Analysis Knowledge Areas:&#x20;

1. u u Needs Assessment. Analyzing current business problems or opportunities to understand what is necessary to attain the desired future state.&#x20;
2. u u Stakeholder Engagement. Identifying and analyzing those who have an interest in the outcome of the solution to determine how to collaborate and communicate with them. u u Elicitation. Planning and preparing for elicitation, conducting elicitation, and confirming elicitation results to obtain information from sources.&#x20;
3. u u Analysis. Examining, breaking down, synthesizing, and clarifying information to further understand it, complete it, and improve it.&#x20;
4. u u Traceability and Monitoring. Tracing, approving, and assessing changes to product information to manage it throughout the business analysis effort.&#x20;
5. u u Solution Evaluation. Validating a full solution or a segment of a solution that is about to be or has already been implemented to determine how well a solution meets the business needs and delivers value to the organization.

Figure 1-5 illustrates the relationships that exist among the six Business Analysis Knowledge Areas. For example:&#x20;

* u u The processes in the Stakeholder Engagement Knowledge Area are used throughout all business analysis efforts and interact with all the other Business Analysis Knowledge Areas;&#x20;
* u u The results obtained by using the processes in the Needs Assessment Knowledge Area are the basis for work conducted using the processes in the Elicitation, Analysis, and Traceability and Monitoring Knowledge Areas;
* u u The processes in the Elicitation, Analysis, and Traceability and Monitoring Knowledge Areas tend to be used concurrently; and&#x20;
* u u The processes in the Elicitation, Analysis, and Traceability and Monitoring Knowledge Areas produce results that are analyzed with the processes in the Solution Evaluation Knowledge Area, which, in turn, may trigger additional usage of the processes in the Needs Assessment Knowledge Area.

* The Standard for Business Analysis presents the work of business analysis as a set of processes, relating those processes to the six Business Analysis Process Groups and six Knowledge Areas. In The Standard for Business Analysis, the Process Groups assist with understanding how business analysis processes are performed. Within this guide, Knowledge Areas are used to group related processes to demonstrate how work is associated or logically related to collectively achieve the objectives of the Knowledge Area.&#x20;
* Table 1-2 maps the 35 business analysis processes within the six Business Analysis Process Groups and the six Business Analysis Knowledge Areas. The business analysis processes depicted in this table are relevant to all projects regardless of the life cycle the project is following. Within this guide, processes are numbered and presented according to the sequence they appear within each Knowledge Area. Within the standard, the sequencing and location of the processes are different, as each is presented according to the order in which it appears within each Process Group.&#x20;
* Table 1-2 provides the reference numbers for locating each process within the guide and standard. The reference number appearing before the process name identifies the section where the process is located in the guide and the reference number in parentheses represents the section where the process is located within the standard.

Business analysis processes are shown in the Process Group in which most of the activity takes place. When a process is performed in the Planning Process Group and its output is updated as part of the work in Executing, the process does not reappear in the Executing Process Group, but instead the process is just performed again. The iterative nature of business analysis means that processes from any group may be used throughout the product life cycle in any order. For example, when managing stakeholder engagement in Monitoring and Controlling, it may be necessary to adjust how best to engage stakeholders after gaining some experience working with them, thereby resulting in a need to revisit the Determine Stakeholder Engagement and Communication Approach process.
