# NEEDS ASSESSMENT

NEEDS ASSESSMENT

Needs Assessment includes the processes used to analyze a current business problem or opportunity, analyze current and future states to determine an optimal solution that will provide value and address the business need, and assemble the results of the analysis to provide decision makers with relevant information for determining whether an investment in the proposed solution is viable.

The Needs Assessment processes are:

4.1 Identify Problem or Opportunity—The process of identifying the problem to be solved or the opportunity to be pursued.

4.2 AssessCurrentState—Theprocessofexaminingthecurrentenvironmentunderanalysistounderstand important factors that are internal or external to the organization, which may be the cause or reason for a problem or opportunity.

4.3 Determine Future State—The process of determining gaps in existing capabilities and a set of proposed changes necessary to attain a desired future state that addresses the problem or opportunity under analysis.

4.4 Determine Viable Options and Provide Recommendation—The process of applying various analysis techniques to examine possible solutions for meeting the business goals and objectives and to determine which of the options is considered the best possible one for the organization to pursue.

4.5 Facilitate Product Roadmap Development—The process of supporting the development of a product roadmap that outlines, at a high level, which aspects of a product that are planned for delivery over the course of a portfolio, program, or one or more project iterations or releases, and the potential sequence for the delivery of these aspects.

4.6 Assemble Business Case—The process of synthesizing well-researched and analyzed information to support the selection of the best portfolio components, programs, or projects to address the business goals and objectives.

4.7 Support Charter Development—The process of collaborating on charter development with the sponsoring entity and stakeholder resources using the business analysis knowledge, experience, and product information acquired during needs assessment and business case development efforts.

Figure 4-1 provides an overview of the Needs Assessment processes. The business analysis processes are presented as discrete processes with defined interfaces, although, in practice, they overlap and interact in ways that cannot be completely detailed in this guide.

**4.1 IDENTIFy PROBlEM OR OPPORTuNITy**

Identify Problem or Opportunity is the process of identifying the problem to be solved or the opportunity to be pursued. The key benefit of this process is the formation of a clear understanding of the situation that the organization is considering to address. If the problem or opportunity is not thoroughly understood, the organization may pursue a solution that does not address the business need. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the process are depicted in Figure 4-2. Figure 4-3 depicts the data flow diagram for the process.

Part of the work performed within Needs Assessment is to identify the problem being solved or the opportunity that needs to be addressed. To avoid focusing on the solution too soon, emphasis is placed on understanding the current environment and analyzing the information uncovered. Asking questions such as “What problem are we solving?” or “What opportunity might transform how we service our customers?” allows for exploring the situation with stakeholders without jumping directly into a solution.

Various types of elicitation are performed to draw out sufficient information to fully identify the problem or opportunity. Once there is a broad understanding of the situation, it is necessary to elicit relevant information to understand the magnitude of the problem or opportunity. Lack of data can result in proposing solutions that are either too small or too large compared to the problem at hand. This process occurs in conjunction with Section 6.3 on Conduct Elicitation, as much of the information needed to identify the problem or opportunity is obtained through effective elicitation.

Once the problem is understood, a situation statement is drafted by documenting the current problem that needs to be solved or the opportunity to be explored. Drafting a situation statement ensures a solid understanding of the problem or opportunity that the organization plans to address. The situation statement is reviewed and approved with key stakeholders to ensure that the solution team has correctly assessed the situation. If the situation statement is not properly understood, or if the stakeholders have a different idea of the situation, there is a risk that the wrong solution will be identified. The business problem or opportunity is defined in support of portfolio and program management activities and occurs pre-project, as it provides the basis from which a business case will be developed.
