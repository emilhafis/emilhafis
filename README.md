### Content Re-use (Domains)

Another feature exclusively available in SwaggerHub is the concept of domains. Domains are re-useable code snippets that you can leverage to avoid duplication in your spec.

When you create definitions for your requests and responses, you may find yourself re-using the same code over and over. Rather than duplicating this code, you can save it as a domain. When you want to re-use the code, you select this domain.

Using the domain minimizes duplicate content and enables you to be more consistent and efficient. You can read more in [Domains](https://app.swaggerhub.com/help/domains/about-domains).
