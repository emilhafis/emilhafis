# The Role of The Business AnAlysT

**3.2 DefiniTion of A Business AnAlysT**

Those who perform business analysis are commonly called business analysts, but there are business analysis professionals with other job titles who also perform business analysis activities. Some business analysis professionals are specialized and therefore have a title that reflects that area of their competency: strategic business analyst, data analyst, process analyst, or systems analyst are a few examples of these roles. How an organization uses business analysis resources; where these resources functionally report; and the type of industry, type of project, and type

of project life cycle being used are some of the factors that influence how organizations title those who have the responsibility for business analysis.

There are also many roles where business analysis is performed as a part of the role but is not necessarily the only responsibility. Enterprise and business architects; portfolio, program, project managers; and operational analysts are a few examples. The business analysis processes, tools, and techniques presented in this guide and standard are relevant to these individuals, too. Because there are many titles and variations of business analysis roles in use, this guide and standard use the phrase business analysis professional over business analyst. When the term business analyst is used, it is done for the sake of brevity and should always be considered a reference to anyone performing business analysis regardless of the title a person holds or the percentage of job function spent on the work. The objective of this guide and standard is to establish an understanding about business analysis and not job titles.

**3.3 The Business AnAlysT’s spheRe of influence**

**3.3.1 ovERviEW**

Business analysts may lead, but they do not oversee project resources; this is the work of the project manager. A lead business analyst may oversee the work of less experienced business analysts on the team, or a manager of business analysis may be responsible for managing a pool of business analyst resources from an assignment or allocation perspective. At the project level, it is the project manager who is responsible for resource allocation, scheduling, and work progress, including that of business analysts.

Business analysts do manage stakeholder engagement, which is often considered an area of overlap with project managers. Looking more closely, business analysts have different objectives from project managers; therefore, each role manages engagement with stakeholders for different purposes. The business analyst’s objective is to ensure that stakeholders remain engaged throughout the entire business analysis process so that the information required to build the solution is attained through ongoing discovery and collaboration and the solution design ultimately meets the needs of the business. The business analyst needs to be aware of stakeholder expectations, availability, and individual interests and the impact each has on the ability to successfully elicit the product requirements. When the dynamics are a cause for one stakeholder group to overpower or shut down another, or when a particular stakeholder becomes disinterested in the solution and begins to withdraw in requirements workshops, it is the business analyst’s responsibility to take charge and resolve these situations. Because stakeholder relationships are managed across the project by the project manager, the best tactic is for the business analyst and project manager to work together when

stakeholder situations arise regarding the solution. More information about the business analyst’s role in managing stakeholder relationships can be found in Section 5.

A business analyst works with stakeholders to elicit and analyze business analysis information and evolve and develop the product requirements and other information necessary to achieve a common understanding of the product features across the product team. This makes relationship building and management a very important aspect of the business analyst role. Business analysts maintain a range of relationships that influence the business analysis work. Figure 3-1 highlights some of the stakeholder relationships that business analysts need to manage within their sphere of influence.

**3.3.3.1 BusinEss AnAlyst RElAtionships**

While the major relationships a business analyst develops and manages are vast, the number of relationships that need to be managed increases as the size and complexity of the project or program increases. The following are some of the typical relationships created and managed by business analysts, along with a description of the value that each relationship provides to the organization and the business analyst:

uuBusiness stakeholders and customers. In some organizations and on some programs and projects, the solution developed is delivered internally to business stakeholders. These stakeholders may also be referred to as “the customer” when the solution is addressing a problem or opportunity directly for their business area.

Other solutions are developed to service stakeholders who are external to the organization, and typically these stakeholders may be referred to as the customer. Business analysts develop strong relationships with those who will be affected by the development of the solution, whether business stakeholder or customer, as it is their needs that the business analyst is ensuring are addressed in the end product. The category of business stakeholders is a broad one, covering all those with an interest in the business; therefore, it can be made up of other role types, such as subject matter experts or users.

uuDesign team. Business analysts support the design team by serving as the business advocate and sharing information about the business need and current state environment. The business analyst can review design proposals and provide feedback that the design team values and considers.

uuGovernance. Depending on the industry, organization, complexity, and risk level of the solution, business analysts often find a need to collaborate with one or more roles within the governance category. Roles considered part of governance include legal, risk, release management, change control boards, DevOps (which some organizations use to coordinate activities and improve collaboration between development and operational areas), a PMO or business analysis center of excellence head, or compliance auditors or officers. Such stakeholders can provide important insights regarding regulations, auditing obligations, business rules, and required organizational processes the product team is obligated to support and adhere to. Business analysts form collaborative relationships with governance roles to ensure that the product development process, including the management of requirements and product information, is performed as required.

uuGovernment. Relationships may need to be established with government agencies at the state, federal, or international level. Typically, product teams are constrained in process or design aspects based on rules and regulations that need to be followed. Business analysts may develop points of contact in these agencies who can provide guidelines, requirements, or answers to questions.

uufunctional managers. Building relationships with functional managers can help a business analyst remove roadblocks, obtain subject matter expert resources to participate in elicitation sessions, and gain key insights into business problems or opportunities of significance to the business. Building rapport with managers provides the business analyst with a strong advocate on the business side who can lend support when issues arise over scope or priorities.

uuportfolio and program managers. Business analysts lend analytical expertise to portfolio and program managers to analyze business problems, recommend viable options, and support decision making about which projects to pursue and how best to prioritize projects and project activities. Business analysts perform business case development and feasibility analysis to support portfolio and program management activities.

uuproject manager. The business analyst and project manager can greatly influence the success of the project when a strong relationship and partnership is established between the two roles. The project manager/ business analyst working relationship should be built upon mutual trust and respect, and all efforts should be made to accentuate each other’s strengths. Collaboration is essential to provide a united front to the sponsor, stakeholders, and other project team members. Communication should be aligned, and each role should be able to support the other in most activities.

uuproject sponsor. The sponsor champions the product and project, and the business analyst advocates on behalf of the sponsor. The business analyst works closely with the sponsor to define the problem or opportunity and identify solutions to address the business need. The business analyst champions the change throughout the project life cycle, serving as the business advocate—a communication bridge to the project team. The business analyst ensures that the business vision is addressed in the solution.

uuproduct team. The product team consists of the resources who act together in conducting the work to develop a product. Members of the project team are members of the product team, but not all product team members may be included on the project team. A product team member is anyone a business analyst interacts with when performing the work of business analysis. Some roles, such as enterprise and business architects, lend support across the organization, including supporting business analysis, but may not be directly allocated as a resource on a project team.

uuproject team. The project team is a group of individuals who act together in performing the work of the project to achieve its objectives. Regardless of the project life cycle selected, the business analyst should strive for a strong relationship with the project team and should be considered a key member. When an organization or project life cycle does not recognize the role of the business analyst, this does not mean the work of business analysis is overlooked by the project team. A scrum team will have a scrum master, a product owner, and the development team. On projects using an agile approach, business analysts learn that their role responsibilities depend on the needs of the project team and that business analysis responsibilities may be spread across roles. Therefore, the relationship to the project team is always critical, but the business analyst’s responsibilities may shift based on the selected project life cycle.

uuproduct quality control (Qc). Developing a good working relationship with the product quality control team, which some organizations refer to as a quality assurance (QA) testing team, provides several benefits. Product quality control analysts are detail oriented and, over time, become experts in the products/solutions they test. This experience is valuable to the business analyst seeking insights into existing solutions. QC analysts are great candidates to review the business analysis deliverables to look for inconsistencies, areas where communications are not clear, or requirements that are not testable. QC analysts should attend requirements review sessions to help business analysts find errors or inconsistencies in requirements and use the experience as an opportunity to ensure a sufficient level of understanding about requirements to conduct the testing activities. QC analysts may even support the business analyst with transition activities. Business analysts can perform a similar review to support QC, looking for errors and issues with test cases and helping QC figure out what to test and by stressing areas of higher risk where testing requires heavier focus.

uuRelationship with other business analysts. Business analysts also manage relationships with other business analysts throughout the organization. Business analysis work may be split across multiple roles, where one business analyst takes responsibility for development of the business case and business requirements and others work with stakeholders to define the requirements for a particular stakeholder group. Still other business analysts may be assigned responsibility over developing the solution and transition requirements. Regardless of how work is divided, business analysts build and promote relationships with other business analysts.

u When business analysts report into a single functional area, establishing relationships with peer business analysts may be easier than in organizations where business analysts are distributed. Some organizations may establish a business analysis community of practice or a center of excellence to enable collaboration among business analysts. Whether formal structures are in place to enable these relationships or not, business analysts can seek to build a network of business analysts across their organization to learn and share best practices. Senior business analysts and business analyst managers support the profession by increasing the business analysis competency levels and capabilities of business analysis within the organization.

uusubject matter experts (sMes). Business analysts work with a vast number of SMEs across all business analysis activities, but do so most heavily during elicitation and analysis. The business analyst leverages a variety of soft skills to maintain good working relationships with SMEs. When SMEs lack respect for the

business analyst or perceive that there is a lack of credibility, honesty, or transparency with the business analyst, the level of SME engagement declines and the overall quality of the elicitation sessions suffers.
