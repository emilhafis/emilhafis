Postman has a nifty import feature that will automatically pull in the same requests you’ve been entering. You can click the Run in Postman buttons below to automatically import these two collections into your own instance of Postman.

#### OpenWeatherMap API collection

If this button doesn’t work for you, copy this [import link](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/abd0d0741e8206266958).

#### Aeris Weather API collection

If this button doesn’t work for you, copy this [import link](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/65dcddab41ff7a773bb1).

Clicking the Run in Postman buttons should automatically prompt you to import the collections into Postman. If it doesn’t work, copy the import link address and, in Postman, click **Import** in the upper-left corner. Then click the **Import From Link** tab, paste in the address and click **Import**.

If you’d like to learn more about Postman, listen to this [interview with the Postman founder](https://idratherbewriting.com/2018/01/22/postman-for-docs-podcast/). We recorded this as part of the [Write the Docs podcast](https://podcast.writethedocs.org/) and focused on the documentation features within Postman. For more information on creating the Run in Postman buttons, see the [Run in Postman button](https://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/docapis\_doc\_getting\_started\_section.html#runinpostmanbutton) section in the [Getting started tutorial](https://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/docapis\_doc\_getting\_started\_section.html).
